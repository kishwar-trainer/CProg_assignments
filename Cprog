13. Check if character is alphabet or not
14. Toggle case of accepted character  eg: input : A     then, output is  a

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loops::
1.Accept number from user and display Multiplication table
2.Accept number from user and calculate and display Factorial
3.Accept number from user and check if it is Armstrong or not eg: 153 = (1)^3 + (5)^3 + (3)^3. 
4.Calculate Sum of digits of a number eg: 123 => 1+2+3 = 6 
5.Accept number from user and display if it is Prime no.
6.Accept limit from user and display Fibonacci series.
7.Display all alphabets A-Z and a-z parallel
8.Multiplication table 2-7
9.Factorial 2 to 7
10.Sum of digits till single digit ans
Extra::
1.Accept number from user and display if it id Perfect no.
2.Accept number and power from user and Calualte Power of no. eg: 2^4 = 16
3.Accept number from user and calculate Reverse of no. in other variable
4.Calculate x+x^2+x^3+……+x^n

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions:

1. Accept limit from user and calculate following series: x + x^2/2! - x^3/3! + ......x^n/n!
Note: make use of separate functions to calculate power and factorial, and note the sequence of + and - is alternate
2.Write a menu driven program to calculate area and circumference/perimeter of circle, square, triangle and rectangle 
  using separate functions for every shape and make sure you display both results in main and get the dimentions 
  in main and pass to function as parameter.
3. write a program to accept variable length of arguments , and display the sum of it all.
4. Write user defined function to calculate square root of user entered number.(do not use build-in function)
5. Accept two numbers from user using separate function find LCM and HCF of numbers.
6. Write a function to find length of user entered number.
7. Accept no.from user in main using separate function and find if entered no.is Armstrong no. Or not. 
It is the no. Where sum of its digits raised to the power of length of number is the original number again. 
Eg:153,371,1634,8208,9474.
Note: use separate functions to find lenght of number.
8. Accept date from user in main in dd/mm/yy format and using function check if date is valid or not and return status.
9. Write a function to find sum of digit and reverse of no. using single function and print both results in main.
10. Check whether a number is an Strong number or not. eg: 145 =  1! + 4! + 5!  (sum of factorial of each digit)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recursion:

1. WAP using recursion to find sum of digits for user entered number
2. WAP using recursion to print reverse of number for user entered number
3. WAP using recursion to find factorial of number for user entered number
Note: Use multiple files(.h, def.c, client.c) for every program and create make file for every program to execute
